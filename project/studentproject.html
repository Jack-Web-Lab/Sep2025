<h2>Research Highlights</h2>
<p>AI-Powered Traffic Prediction System</p>
<p>A group of diploma students developed an AI model that predicts city traffic flow using machine-learning algorithms and real-time data. The system achieved 89% accuracy and demonstrated how computing can improve smart city planning. The project was supervised by the School of Computing’s research team.</p>

<h2>Innovation Showcase</h2>

<p>Smart Attendance App Using QR & Facial Recognition</p>
<p>Degree students created an innovative attendance-tracking mobile app that integrates QR scanning with optional facial-recognition verification. The system minimizes proxy attendance and improves reliability for lecturers. It was later adopted for internal use during workshops and events.</p>

<h2>⭐⭐ Student Testimonials ⭐⭐</h2>

<h3>Aisha Rahman – Degree in Computing</h3>

<p>"The programme gave me strong fundamentals in coding and software design. I appreciated how the lecturers encouraged creativity in every assignment. My final-year project turned into an internship opportunity, which helped launch my career."
</p>

<h3>Jason Lim – Diploma in Computing</h3>

<p>"I enjoyed the hands-on learning approach. We spent a lot of time in the lab building real applications instead of just learning theory. The supportive environment helped me unlock my interest in cybersecurity."
</p>

<h3>Nurul Izzaty – Degree in Computing</h3>

<p>"Data science felt intimidating at first, but the lecturers explained difficult concepts in simple ways. The projects involving real datasets were the most exciting part. I now feel ready to pursue a data analyst role."
</p>

<h3>Kelvin Ong – Short Courses (Web Development Bootcamp)</h3>

<p>"The short course was fast-paced but extremely practical. Within a few weeks, I learned how to build a complete website. The instructors were friendly, and the exercises helped me understand how websites work."

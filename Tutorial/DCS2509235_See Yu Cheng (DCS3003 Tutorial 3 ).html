<p>A <font size=5><strong><i>shepherd</font></strong></i> boy in a village used to take his herd of sheep across the fields near the forest. He felt this job was very dull and wanted to have some fun.</p>
<br>

<p>One day while <u>grazing</u> the sheep, he shouted,"Wolf!Wolf!The wolf is carrying away a lamb!"Farmers working in the nearby fields came running for help but did't find any wolf.</p>
<br>

<p>The boy laughed and replied,"It was just fun> There is no wolf here".<font size=5><strong><i>The boy played a similar trick repeatedly for many days.</font></strong></i></p>
<br>

<p>After some days, while the shepherd boy was in the field with the herd of sheep, suddenly, a wolf came out from the nearby forest and attacked one of the lambs. The boy was frightened and cried loudly,"Wolf!Wolf!<strike>The wolf is carrying a lamb away!"</strike></p>
<br>

<p><font color=BE81C7>The farmers <sup>thought</sup> the boy was playing <sub>mischief</sub> again</font>. So, no one paid attention to him and did't come to his help.</p>
